# DriveMoteur
Arduino based motor drive

This library is used to controle DC motor via H-Bridge.

It provide function to control the acceleration of the motor.
Whit it, you don't have to call delay to make ramp, you can still do your "loop" and wait for event
while the motor is still accelerating. This can be used if you need a sweat motor control without high peak.

Feel free to comment and add suggestion. I'm doing this for fun and robotic use of my project :P
